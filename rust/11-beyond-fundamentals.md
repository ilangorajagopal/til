# Going beyond the fundamentals

So I haven't posted here about learning Rust in a while. I've been doing exercises on Exercism's Rust track and solving Rustlings.

Solutions to both can be viewed online:

1. Rustlings: https://github.com/ilangorajagopal/rustlings
2. Exercism: https://exercism.org/profiles/ilango/solutions

As I solve (try to, more like) more and more problems, I'm finding even the fundamentals have some subtleties that are tied to more advanced concepts.

Seems like those can be learned only by diving deeper and trying to solve harder problems. 

Like any beginner, I'm doing naive implementations first before checking for better solutions. Exercism is really good for this. I can only check community solutions after I've solved the problem and all tests pass. That way I learn first and then boost my learning with better solutions.
